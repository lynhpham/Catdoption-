            <p>We are a non-profit cat adoption center located in Atlanta, Georgia!
            We are open from Monday to Friday. Our hours are from 10 AM to 6PM.
            There are many abandoned cats on the streets that struggle to survive on
            their own. Our mission is to find a loving forever home for all of our little
            furry friends.</p>
            <p>Our adoptions fees are $150.00. Each adopted cat have recieved all
            up to date shots, are spayed/ neutured, and microchipped. Your adoption
            fees allow us to continue saving vulnerable cats on the streets. They
            go towards medication and treatments to sick cats that are brought in.</p>
            <p>Due to COVID-19, we are limiting the amount of people in our store
            for the safety of everyone. Please come with a mask to keep everyone safe.
            Our new policy requires each potential adopters to create an account
            with us to schedule visiting hours and to fill out some paperwork into
            our online database. This allows us to have access to your information
            instantly.</p>
